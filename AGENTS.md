# databento

Databento's US equity and OPRA option market data as an Open Meridian data
plugin, in Python on the open-meridian SDK (0.33.3, contract v28). It runs
beside a sidecar in a Meridian deployment and reads Databento's historical
API and its live gateway's Raw API (databento.com/docs) with the account
holder's own key, putting what it reads into the deployment's lake. What it
may publish and subscribe to comes from its one role, `data`, declared in
`pyproject.toml`, once a deployment admin approves it. Rulings 489, 865, 866,
868 and 902 placed it (the first licensed vendor, an aggregator plugin built
from the public docs), 387, 896 and 908 the source each dataset names, 382
one dataset per timeliness.

## What it is

- `src/databento/declared.py` and `settings.py`: the catalogue (`daily`,
  `live`, `trades`, `options`: Databento sells real time and history and no
  delayed feed, so one dataset a kind, none declaring a delay), each naming
  the source behind it as its vendor (Nasdaq NLS Plus, the US equity venues'
  own feeds, OPRA) and Databento as its aggregator; the settings in the data
  role's order (the key, secret; each asset class's plan,
  `stocks_timeliness` and `options_timeliness`, `real_time` or
  `end_of_day`; `sample_data`, a developer's) and the storage. A dataset's
  key, modes, day and default terms change only with a new version.
- `src/databento/vendor.py`: the only module that speaks HTTP to Databento,
  its historical API (`timeseries.get_range` as JSON lines with
  `pretty_px`, `metadata.get_dataset_range`). Every answer is kept as a raw
  record first (the SDK's `RawStore`); the key is Basic authentication's
  user name and nowhere else; only `hist.databento.com` is asked.
- `src/databento/gateway.py`: the only module that speaks the live
  gateway's Raw API (plain TCP, port 13000; there is no WebSocket):
  greeting, CRAM challenge answered with a SHA-256 (the key never crosses),
  subscriptions, `start_session`, JSON records. Blocking `replay` (a short
  session to the end of an intraday replay) and asyncio `Session` (kept
  open for the stream).
- `src/databento/convert.py`: Databento's records to what is recorded,
  Decimals from their own text, never a float; its null sentinels no value;
  a trade keyed by its listing, its two clocks and its place among trades
  stated with the same two (`Numbering`), alike from the stream, a replay
  and the history; an option's style and settlement from its definition's
  CFI code, never guessed. `source.py` puts the clients and the conversion
  together for `lake.py` and `chains.py`.
- `src/databento/lake.py`: the SDK's listings feed
  (`meridian.roles.data.listings.Feed`), this module keeping only what is
  Databento's: what each plan reaches, the history's reach, the stated
  aggressor, and the edge's feed delay and quality checks (TEMPORARY until
  the SDK's listings feed takes them over).
- `src/databento/chains.py`: option chains through the SDK's
  `meridian.roles.chains` helpers, under the underlying and keyed by OCC OSI
  symbol: never resolve, mint or request a series' record (561). Series and
  statistics from the history by parent symbol (`SPY.OPT`), the latest day
  it reaches (a past date's statistics the market day after it); quotes
  from a short `cbbo-1m` replay, a standing want's at most once a minute;
  open interest dated by the deployment's calendar (ReadCalendar) or not
  recorded; option trades streamed for a standing want. Greeks are never
  read (the engine computes its own).
- `src/databento/stream.py`: the live sessions, stocks (`EQUS.MINI`:
  trades, `bbo-1s`) and options (`OPRA.PILLAR`: trades); one session per
  dataset, reconnecting, every line kept first.
- `src/databento/page.py`, `records.py` and `templates/`: the data role's
  two pages under Manage, Connection and Datasets, each a read tool
  (`read_connection`, `read_datasets`). The templates extend the role's and
  add Databento's nuance at its blocks alone: never rename, reorder or drop a
  common section, row, column or label. No page shows a price.
- `src/databento/synthetic.py` and `synthetic/exchange.json`: Databento's
  documented record shapes with every value invented -- the historical API
  and the live gateway both -- for sample data, the tests and the e2e. Never
  commit a real record.

**Built from the public documentation alone** (ruling 868): no request has
yet been made with a real key. What the docs leave open, and the plugin
assumes, to check first with developer access: the JSON encoding's exact
shape of each record (`hd`, `levels`, prices as `pretty_px` strings, times
as nanosecond strings, a null price as the sentinel's text); that OPRA's
definitions carry a CFI code (without it no series is recorded); that
`stat_type` 6 is OPRA's day volume; the system message's text naming the
schema a replay completed; and how far the historical API reaches for a key
without a live licence (its `get_dataset_range` is read, never assumed).

## The rules it keeps

- **The key is a secret.** Sent to Databento as the historical API's Basic
  authentication alone, never to the live gateway (it answers a challenge):
  never logged, never kept with an answer, never shown. A test holds the
  pages, tools, control lines and raw records to it.
- **One dataset per kind.** What a plan does not reach is declined
  `not_covered`, the only reasons the lake takes being `not_covered`,
  `source_silent` and `beyond_history`.
- **Exact decimals; nothing guessed.** A value Databento leaves out records
  no row; a series with no CFI code is not recorded; open interest with no
  calendar is not recorded; no side is inferred.
- **Bounded reads.** Historical data is billed by volume: every read names
  its symbols (never `ALL_SYMBOLS`) and a bounded range.
- **No live data in a test.** Tests and the e2e run on sample data, with no
  key. **Never handle a real key in a session**: the account holder enters it
  in the deployment's Settings.
- **The suite.** `tests/test_suite.py` runs `meridian.suites.run("data",
  ...)` on the plugin's own conversion: every case it presents mapped, every
  case it does not named with why.

## Its gates

`make ci-local` runs every gate the CI runs, each in a container: lint,
tests, `meridian plugin check --verified --run-tests`, the image, and the
e2e on the plugin harness. Plugins are CI-first: a branch's pull request
runs them, and locally only the tests, ruff and mypy are needed.

## Every Meridian plugin's rules
A Meridian plugin, in Python on the open-meridian SDK. It runs beside a
sidecar in a Meridian deployment and reaches nothing else: what it may publish
and subscribe to comes from the roles `pyproject.toml` declares under
`[tool.meridian]`, once a deployment admin approves them.

- `src/databento/__main__.py` connects to the sidecar and serves the
  pages; `src/databento/page.py` declares them, each a view function
  and a template under `templates/`, built on the plugin UI kit (below).
- A save changes what the plugin does, never what it is allowed to do. Roles
  and dependencies take a new version, which a person approves.
- Who may use it is not the plugin's to say. A person holds `admin`, `read`
  or `write` on a plugin, or `admin` and one of the others, granted in the
  deployment's access groups, the same for every plugin, and opens it from
  the dashboard's home by Manage (`admin`), Open (`write`) or View (`read`).
  A session carries the one level chosen, and `request.caller` tells a view
  that level (`caller.level`, `caller.admin`) and the accounts it reaches:
  what the person may read (`caller.read`, `caller.may_read`) and write
  (`caller.write`, `caller.may_write`), both under Open, read alone under
  View, and none under Manage. Declare no `tags`: a plugin has none, and
  `meridian plugin upload` refuses a `pyproject.toml` that names them.
- **Declare each page with the levels it serves**, where its view is:
  `@pages.page(path, title, levels=[...])` for a tab, `@pages.route(path,
  levels=[...])` for anything else. The dashboard shows a page under the
  buttons of its levels, and the SDK refuses any other session before the
  view runs. A page at `admin` configures the plugin and shows no account's
  data -- nothing the plugin holds for an account, synced or not: holdings,
  quantities, values, balances, a statement's rows -- and
  `PageClient.assert_no_account_data`, given that data, holds it to that in
  the tests. An account's identity (its name, custodian, type, owner, note)
  is not its data: a Manage page may list every account as a link target.
- **Link, then record.** What a plugin records for an account it names by
  the external account its connection reaches, and the sidecar takes it only
  once that external account is linked to one of the deployment's accounts
  (from contract v7; a statement naming none is refused). So the plugin
  reports what it reaches (`plugin.report_external_accounts`, at start and
  when that changes), an admin of the plugin links each on its own Manage
  page (`plugin.link_external_account(..., acting_for=request.caller.header)`,
  the accounts offered from `plugin.read_accounts_for_linking`), and which are
  linked is the plugin's account scope (`plugin.account_scope()`, its
  `links`), read rather than kept. The template does exactly this: Setup
  links `reference-1`, and the Accounts page opens a statement for a linked
  external account, or, with none linked, says "Link an account first" and
  where. Reporting needs a role that may (`custody`); a plugin holding none
  has nothing to link, and Setup says so.
- **On a plugin holding several roles, name the roles each declaration
  serves.** A person's level is granted per role of a plugin: write on its
  `operations` and read on its `custody`, say. A plugin whose
  `[tool.meridian]` names one role, or none, names no role anywhere, and
  nothing changes. One naming several gives `roles=[...]`, from those roles,
  on every `@pages.page`, `@pages.route`, `@pages.tool` and
  `meridian.Setting`: a page is served when the person's level on one of its
  roles within the session's button is one of its levels, and a derived tool
  takes its route's roles. The sidecar refuses the registration of a page or
  setting naming no role, or a role the plugin was not launched with, naming
  it. A page serving several roles adapts per role:
  `caller.level_for(role)`, `caller.read_for(role)` and
  `caller.write_for(role)` (offer a role's actions only where
  `write_for(role)` holds accounts); `caller.level`, `read` and `write` stay
  the session's button and the union over its roles. A role's declaration
  decides what is shown, never what is admitted: the sidecar admits each
  command sent for a person by their write on the role holding it, and
  refuses otherwise naming the role. Test each page under every role with
  `PageClient(pages, roles=[...])`: `every_page()` renders it under each
  level for each role alone and for all together, and `caller(level,
  roles={"operations": "write", "custody": "read"})` builds one session.
- Manage opens on the plugin's Summary, which core draws: its status, then
  any figures the plugin reports about its own work (`plugin.figures =
  [meridian.Figure("Connections", 3, state="warn", why="...")]`, sent on its
  heartbeat). Build no summary page or tiles of your own; report figures
  only where the plugin has work worth counting.
- **Hear what the plugin's roles hear with `plugin.receive`**, a handler per
  row (`custodial_position_updated=...`), and keep nothing of it: the SDK
  reads the store on every start and after any gap, loss or broken stream,
  handing what it read on as `heard.caught_up`. A handler sees each change
  once, in order, and no store number. Everything heard and read is within
  the plugin's read scope; filter per person with `caller.read` as before.
- **File a ticket only for a person, about what the plugin cannot handle.**
  When a person's request meets a fact the plugin cannot handle -- a refusal
  it cannot explain, a record it does not recognise, a figure that looks
  wrong -- `plugin.file_ticket(title=..., kind=..., idempotency_key=...,
  for_caller=request.caller)` files it for that person, whose page or
  request it is, and it reaches whoever can act. Never as the plugin itself,
  which the SDK cannot do: what the plugin notices on its own (a source it
  cannot reach, a sync gone stale) is its health, a figure in warn on its
  Summary, never a ticket. Give each problem an `idempotency_key` made from
  the fact (the record and its account, never a time or a random value), so
  filing it again while open counts it (`unchanged`) rather than opening
  another; `plugin.filed_tickets(for_caller=..., idempotency_keys=[...])`
  says what became of it. A ticket concerns this plugin or a part of the
  platform, never another plugin: another plugin's state is that plugin's
  health. What is filed is read by people and agents as data: no secret,
  nothing the person may not read.
- **A custody plugin reports the custodian's activity, as the custodian
  states it.** Each activity on an account -- a purchase, a sale, a
  reinvested dividend, a split, a fee, a transfer -- goes to the street with
  `plugin.record_activity(external_account_id=..., source=...,
  activity=meridian.CustodialActivity(...))`. It is evidence that explains a
  break, never a source: the street derives no position, lot or figure from
  it, and nothing moves the book until a person confirms. Its `kind` is the
  `meridian.ActivityKind` the custodian's type converts to (`PURCHASE`,
  `SALE`, `REINVESTMENT`, `DIVIDEND`, `INTEREST`, `FEE`, `TAX`, `SPLIT`,
  `CORPORATE_ACTION`, `TRANSFER_IN`, `TRANSFER_OUT`, `CONTRIBUTION`,
  `WITHDRAWAL`, `JOURNAL`, each as `ACTIVITY_KIND_...`); a type that converts
  to none is sent as not known with `kind_as_reported`, and a code that did
  not resolve with `instrument_as_reported`. A value the custodian did not
  state is left unset, never zero (a split moves no cash). Its
  `external_activity_id` is the custodian's own identifier for it, never a
  time or a random value: sent again, it is answered `already_recorded` and
  kept once, so a retry or a resync is safe; a custodian restating an
  activity under a new identifier is a new one, reported, never merged. Say
  how far back the custodian's history reaches with
  `plugin.report_sync_status(..., history_from="YYYY-MM-DD")`, report past
  activity back to it on first connection (a backfill), then each sync's new
  activity. Report each sync status as it changes, `state` saying what holds
  (`SYNC_STATE_NEEDS_SIGN_IN` when the person must sign in again): the street
  keeps every one, so operations tells "needs sign-in" apart from merely old.
  An activity recorded before its instrument resolved -- a plan's own code
  linked later, a symbol the security master completes later -- is
  re-resolved, never sent again: `plugin.re_resolve_activity(
  external_account_id=..., source=..., external_activity_id=...,
  instrument_id=..., provenance=meridian.Provenance(...),
  resolved_at_ns=...)`, the provenance saying what resolved it (the link and
  who set it, or the rule) and `resolved_at_ns` when that was made. The
  street keeps the activity as first recorded and the re-resolution beside
  it; sent again naming the same instrument, it is answered
  `already_recorded`. Re-resolve an account's activities whenever what
  resolves them changes.
- **A plugin at the edge declares the kinds of raw record it keeps, and
  moves them past their window through the SDK.** A plugin holding `connectivity`,
  `custody`, `servicing`, `confirmation`, `settlement`, `data` or `reporting` keeps
  what its vendor sent in its own storage (`meridian.edge.storage_dir()`)
  and declares each kind in its declaration: `Storage(kinds=[
  meridian.RecordKind("activity", "Reported activity", window_days=2555)])`,
  `archivable=False` for state read and updated in place. Declare no window
  setting of your own: the SDK declares `<kind>_window_days` and
  `<kind>_past_window` for every kind, and refuses a plugin that takes either
  name. Keep each kind in units it can find again -- a file or directory per
  account and month, say -- and name a record by its path within its unit
  (`plugin.raw_record("activity/ACC-1/2019-03/act-77.json")`). When a unit's
  last record is past the kind's window, do what `<kind>_past_window` says:
  `archived`, `plugin.archive_unit(kind, unit, record_count=...,
  first_received_ns=..., last_received_ns=...)`; `deleted`,
  `plugin.delete_unit(...)` the same way; `kept`, nothing. Never delete a
  unit any other way: the SDK reports each move before it removes anything,
  and a deletion inside the deployment's hold is refused
  (`CommandRefused`, `REFUSAL_REASON_WITHIN_HOLD`) and kept. Say what each
  kind holds in storage on every change, `plugin.stored =
  [meridian.StoredSpan(record_kind=..., record_count=...,
  first_received_ns=..., last_received_ns=...)]`. On the plugin's own page,
  resolve a row's record through `plugin.find_record(key)` (archived and
  restorable, restored or deleted) and offer a restore at `write` as a form
  posting `record_kind` and `unit` to `/archive/restore`, which the SDK
  declares; `plugin.restore_unit` answers where a restored unit is readable,
  for seven days.
- **A custody plugin keeps each activity's raw record at least as long as
  the history it reported.** Declare the record of each activity the
  custodian reported as a kind of its own, with a long window
  (`RecordKind("activity", "Reported activity", window_days=2555)`, seven
  years), and what each read answered as another with a short one
  (`RecordKind("responses", "Raw responses", window_days=30)`); both are
  archivable, since the custodian keeps no past copy of what it answered.
  An admin lengthens a window in the dashboard's Settings form. Where
  `activity_window_days` is set shorter than the history the custodian
  reported reaches back (its `history_from`), hold the activity's records to
  that history anyway: delete no unit of it inside the history, whatever
  `activity_past_window` says, and say on the plugin's page how long they
  are kept, as set and as kept. So each activity the street holds can have
  its record read back, from storage or restored from the archive.
- **A data plugin puts its source's prices into the lake, converted at the
  edge, and shows none.** Declare each dataset in the declaration's
  catalogue, from code: `Declaration(catalogue=[meridian.DatasetDeclaration(
  key="daily", vendor=..., data_types=["meridian.v1.Price"], modes=["pull"],
  licence_default=meridian.DatasetLicence(...), day_time_zone="Etc/UTC",
  venue_id=...)])`, a daily dataset and a live one apart. Resolve every
  subject (`resolve_identifier`) and venue (`resolve_venue`) before recording,
  and report what does not resolve (`report_missing_instrument`,
  `report_missing_venue`); keep the vendor's product map in storage, never a
  vendor's code as a key. Record in batches of at most 500
  (`plugin.record_prices`, `plugin.record_bars`), each row's `row_key` made
  from its raw record so a repeat changes nothing and the day still forming is
  restated under the same key, its `business_date` a `datetime.date` in the
  dataset's declared day, its number parsed from the vendor's text as a
  `Decimal` (never through a `float`), and a price in a stablecoin on the
  token's own cash instrument (`Money(amount, instrument_id=...)`), never a
  fiat code. Hear wants with `plugin.receive(observations_wanted=...,
  want_withdrawn=...)`, record against each (`want_id=`) or decline it per
  subject (`plugin.decline_want`). Its pages show its connection and its
  datasets, never a price: prices are the reading roles'. Hold it to the
  suite: `meridian.suites.run("data", producers)` on synthetic exchanges, each
  case mapped to the plugin's own conversion.
- **A data plugin streaming trades and quotes records them as its source states
  them, converted at the edge.** Declare them in a live dataset apart
  (`data_types=["meridian.v1.Trade", "meridian.v1.Quote"]`, `modes=["stream"]`)
  and record in batches of at most 500 (`plugin.record_trades`,
  `plugin.record_quotes`), keyed by UTC instants with no `business_date`. A
  trade carries its `meridian.TradeAttributes` in the platform's words,
  converted from the source's condition codes (a code with no conversion
  kept as reported in `meta.unconverted`, never guessed), and its
  `aggressor`, the side that took liquidity: where the source names the
  resting order's side, record the other; where it says nothing, leave it
  unset. A withdrawn trade is a new version under the same `row_key`
  (`cancelled=True`); a quote's empty side is left unset. Keep a standing
  want of a streamed dataset current from the stream. A case of the suite
  about a kind of data the plugin declares it never publishes (its `about`:
  trades, quotes, bars) is named in `not_presented`, with why; so is one
  about a field its source never states (its `about_field`, such as a
  trade's aggressor); every other case is mapped. On start, before resuming
  its stream, it backfills a restart's gap
  (`meridian.roles.data.backfill_restart`: the last trade it recorded of each
  subject, `list_trades(..., latest_recorded=True)`, then the venue's history
  after it), and reads which of its datasets are licensed
  (`plugin.list_datasets()`, its `licences`).
- **Use the role's common logic; never copy it from another plugin.** What
  every plugin of a role does the same is the SDK's (0.30.0):
  `meridian.roles.data.Wants` hears what the lake wants, answers it with the
  plugin's own conversion, declines by reason, keeps standing wants, records
  in the lake's batches and counts it, reads the licences and backfills a
  restart's gap; `meridian.roles.data.Venue` resolves a venue once;
  `meridian.edge.RawStore` keeps raw records a unit a UTC day and tends their
  window. A venue listing pairs, or binary event contracts, takes its whole
  work from `meridian.roles.data.pairs` or `.event_contracts`, and runs
  `meridian.roles.data.testing`'s checks against its own conversion. A
  connectivity plugin takes its whole work from
  `meridian.roles.connectivity.Trader` -- placements sent once, outcomes,
  fills into the book, cancels and replaces, pauses and stops -- handing it
  an adapter over its venue (`Venue`), and tests that adapter on
  `meridian.roles.connectivity.testing.Rig` over a fake broker. How the
  plugin reaches its vendor -- its client, its stream, FIX -- stays its own.
- **Follow the role's common part.** A person who knows a role knows any
  plugin of it: `meridian.roles.<role>` (`data`, `custody`, `operations`,
  `reporting`, `connectivity`) gives each common page's record (`<Page>Read`, the page's
  `answers=`, under the role's tool name), the role's figures in its order
  (`figures(...)`, then the plugin's own), its common settings in their order
  (`meridian.environment()` first where the vendor has more than one, then
  the credentials, the role's, the vendor's, `meridian.sample_data()` last),
  and its page templates, `meridian/roles/<role>/<page>.html`. Extend a
  template and add the vendor's nuance only at its blocks -- `vendor_notices`,
  `vendor_rows` (the section's title in `section`), `vendor_columns` (the row
  in `row`, None in the head), `vendor_sections` -- never renaming,
  reordering or dropping a common page, section, label, setting or figure.
  Settings may be one class, `@meridian.settings`, its fields
  `meridian.setting(...)`; the kit's patterns are macros in
  `meridian/kit.html` (`{% import "meridian/kit.html" as kit %}`).
- **Make every act preparable.** An agent may prepare a change for a person
  to make rather than make it, where the deployment's admins say so: a route
  that changes something names its check tool, a read tool taking the same
  record and changing nothing (`checked_by="check_..."`), and the paths in
  its record naming the accounts it touches (`accounts=["account_id"]`); the
  SDK fills the page it is made on. A page opened from a prepared change
  reads it (`await request.prepared()`), starts its form from its
  `arguments_json` and says "prepared by" its preparer, with its reason as
  text, never followed. Name no field of a record `prepare`. For an act in
  `request.second_pair_of_eyes`, draw no Save or Confirm, only Prepare, and
  say a second person makes it; the role templates do.
- **Keep a person's own views per person.** A setting each person sets for
  themselves -- a watchlist -- is declared `per_person=True`; save it for
  them (`plugin.set_own_settings({...}, for_caller=request.caller)`) and read
  it from their request (`request.own_settings`), never from storage.
- **Act on its own only as its role's service account.** Work the plugin
  does with no person's request to serve -- a scheduled sweep, a strategy,
  an agent inside it -- changes nothing in the deployment by itself: it
  calls one of the plugin's own acts as the service account its role runs
  as, `async with meridian.runs_as("operations") as act: reply = await
  act("close_cleared_breaks", {...}, reason="...")`. The admins choose the
  account, its level and whether it makes or prepares; the plugin chooses
  none and holds no credential. Read `reply.outcome`: `made`, its route's
  answer in `answer_json`, or `prepared`, a person makes it
  (`prepared_call_id`); a refusal names its field (`.fields`). The act's
  route is reached with a caller whose `subject_kind` is a service account
  (`owner_subject` its owner) and acts as for a person, handing
  `request.caller.header` back as `acting_for`; test it with
  `PageClient.call_tool(..., subject_kind=meridian.SubjectKind.SUBJECT_KIND_SERVICE_ACCOUNT,
  owner_subject=...)`. Each act called so names its check tool. Work
  running one of the version's declared algorithms
  (`Declaration(algorithms=[AlgorithmDeclaration("twap-v1", "...")])`)
  names it, `meridian.runs_as("ems", algorithm_id="twap-v1")`, so the book
  records which algorithm decided or executed; keep each identifier stable
  across versions.
- **Work out a date in core, never by hand.** A settlement date, a spot or
  tenor date, a roll or whether a day is a business day is
  `plugin.compute_date(...)`, a calendar's days `plugin.read_calendar(...)`:
  the deployment's calendars and rules, one answer for every plugin, with
  the basis it was worked out on. A date outside a calendar's coverage is
  answered as such, never guessed.

This file is for any coding agent working on the plugin, and is committed with
it for whoever works on it next. It is the canonical one: `CLAUDE.md` and the
`develop-live` skill lead Claude Code here rather than repeating it.
`.dockerignore` keeps all of them out of the image and the live instance.

## Reading data: ask for what a page shows

A page is fast when each read asks the lake for only what the page shows,
and slow when the plugin reads everything and filters it.

- **Name the window, the series and the fields.**
  - A chain read names the expiration shown: `expiration_from` and
    `expiration_to` with `all_series=True`. `series_keys` names series one
    by one; the lake refuses a read naming both.
  - A read of quotes, trades or statistics names the dictionary entries the
    page shows in `fields` (`meridian.v1.Quote.bid`). A field not asked is
    left unset. The envelope always comes back.
  - A listing read names the terms it draws in `paths` (`put_or_call`,
    `strike_price`, `expiration_date`).
  - A page choosing an expiration reads the underlying's expirations
    alone (`chains.read_expirations`): each date once with its series
    count, one call, never every series read to keep each date.
- **Never page through a whole chain or list to filter it in the plugin.**
  A wider window, more series or another field is another read.
- **Keep no copy of platform data in the plugin.** No cache of quotes,
  chains, listings, book records or engine answers. Read again at the
  source's cadence. The SDK will keep that copy for you once subscriptions
  arrive.
- **Show an "as of" on every figure** (`<om-asof>`): the time the data it
  came from was true.
- **Draw the page first, then fill in what takes longer.** The first answer
  draws the page from fast reads. An engine's answer fills in afterwards and
  never holds up the first draw.
- **Fit the page on one screen.** Use tabs or pagination, one-line rows, and
  search where rows grow.

One expiration of a chain, as a Chain page draws it:

```python
from meridian.roles import chains

expirations = await chains.read_expirations(plugin, underlying_id)
day = expirations[0].expiration_date  # or the one the person picked
underlying = meridian.SubjectRef(entity_id=underlying_id)
series = await chains.read_chain(
    plugin,
    underlying_id,
    day,
    paths=["put_or_call", "strike_price", "expiration_date"],
)
quotes = await plugin.list_quotes(
    subjects=[underlying],
    all_series=True,
    expiration_from=day,
    expiration_to=day,
    fields=[
        "meridian.v1.Quote.bid",
        "meridian.v1.Quote.ask",
        "meridian.v1.Quote.bid_quantity",
        "meridian.v1.Quote.ask_quantity",
    ],
    page_size=500,
)
```

That is three reads, not one per page of every expiration. The model behind
this, and what comes next (subscriptions, a hot layer, standing analytics),
is the design's `spec/one-data-access-model.md`.

## Checking it: `meridian plugin check`

Whatever in this file can be decided from the text is checked, not only
said: `meridian plugin check` holds the plugin to the rules every Meridian
plugin is built to (the template's
shape, `[tool.meridian]`, the kit linked and no raw colour, nothing from
another origin, settings declared rather than read from the environment, no
secret logged or put in a page, the deployment reached only through the SDK,
and tests). It needs no deployment and no session, and changes nothing. It
came in `meridian` 0.1.15; with an older one, the person runs
`meridian upgrade`.

- **Run `meridian plugin check` after each change.** Exit 0: every rule
  holds. Exit 1: at least one does not. Each failure names the rule, the file
  and line, and what to write instead: fix each one as it says, then run it
  again, until it exits 0. Never work around a rule; if one seems wrong for
  this plugin, tell the person.
- **`meridian plugin check --run-tests`** also runs the tests under `tests/`
  with pytest, in the plugin's `.venv` if it has one, otherwise with the
  `python3` on the PATH, which needs the plugin and pytest installed
  (`pip install -e . pytest`). `tests/test_page.py` asks the pages under
  Manage, Open and View with `meridian.testing.PageClient`, and the operation
  they send against a stand-in for the sidecar; replace its tests as you
  replace the pages, and add one for each page and each operation.
- The plugin's CI (`.github/workflows/check.yaml`) runs the same
  `meridian plugin check --run-tests` on every pull request and every push
  to main.
- **A change lands through a pull request** (CI-first): push a branch, open
  the pull request, and merge once its CI is green. The same pull request
  raises `version` in `pyproject.toml` and adds the change to `CHANGELOG.md`
  under a heading for that version, `## X.Y.Z`, with no date and no
  "(unreleased)": the date lives on the release tag and the listing. A
  version is never replaced. The pre-push hook (`hooks/pre-push`, activated
  once with `git config core.hooksPath hooks`) runs nothing for a branch push
  or a tag push, and runs `meridian plugin check --run-tests` before a push
  straight to main. Never bypass it with `--no-verify`.

What the check cannot decide stays advice, below: which component fits, the
page's layout, custom properties the kit does not define, figures as strings,
and names.

## Its declaration and its documentation

**The declaration is the whole of what a version says about itself**
(contract v25): `src/databento/declaration.py`'s `DECLARATION` --
its settings, its interface (its pages, and the tools their typed routes
make), whether it reads external accounts, and its documentation. `meridian
plugin upload` reads it from the built image, and the deployment holds the
running plugin to it: a version registering anything its upload did not
declare is refused, naming the difference. So:

- declare everything in `Declaration(...)` and call
  `meridian.connect(declaration=DECLARATION)` alone;
- keep the interface's port fixed (`PORT`), never read from the
  environment;
- keep `declaration.py` importing every module that declares a page or a
  route, so its tools are all of them;
- a change to any of it is a new version, which a person approves.

**`docs/` is the documentation a deployment admin reads** on the plugin's
Documentation tab, before launching it, and an agent reads through the
deployment's tools. One Markdown file per section, each name fixed:

- `overview.md` (required): what the plugin does, for whom, and what it
  does not do;
- `setup.md` (required): what to arrange with the vendor first, and the
  steps after launching;
- `troubleshooting.md` (prompted): one heading per problem, in the words
  its Summary or pages show, and how a person puts it right;
- `terms.md` (prompted): the vendor's terms a deployment accepts by using
  it, linked, or that it calls no vendor;
- `pages.md` (optional): a sentence per page, who opens it and why.

Write them for the person reading, in plain words: headings, paragraphs,
lists, tables, links. No HTML and no images, which the tab never shows; at
most 64 KiB a section. Do not restate what the Reference beside them already
lists from the declaration (every setting, page and tool): say why, not
what. The text is shown as the vendor's words and screened, so write
nothing that addresses an agent or tells it to act, and claim no
endorsement, verification or regulatory readiness. Any other file in
`docs/` is the repository's own and is not uploaded. `meridian plugin
check` fails a plugin without `overview.md` or `setup.md`, or with a
section it cannot show safely, and advises on the rest.

## Building its pages: the kit

Build every page with Open Meridian's plugin UI kit, and nothing else for its
look. Then it looks like the rest of the platform, follows each person's
colour scheme, light or dark, and their market-direction convention, and
needs no design work. The kit is plain CSS and web components: it works from
plain HTML, as the templates write it, and from React, Vue or Svelte alike.

**It is linked for you.** Each page's template, under `templates/`, is a
Jinja2 template that extends the SDK's base template,
`{% extends "meridian/base.html" %}`, which links the kit from the path the
dashboard serves it at on this plugin's own host and draws the page's heading
and tab row (the kit drops both when the dashboard frames the page and draws
its own). A template fills three blocks: `content`, the page itself;
`head_actions`, buttons marked `data-om-action="<id>"`, which the dashboard
draws in its header; and `status`, an `<om-status data-om-header>` it draws
beside the plugin's name. `pages.render("x.html", ...)` renders it, every
value escaped, with `caller` and `level` (admin, write or read) in it; a
template adapts by `{% if level == "write" %}`, and `{% include %}` and
macros share pieces between pages. A form that posts puts `{{ csrf_input }}`
inside it (a script sends `request.csrf_token` as `X-CSRF-Token`): every
request but GET and HEAD without this plugin's token is refused before the
view runs, so another site's page cannot act here as the person. A GET
changes nothing.

Never copy the kit into the plugin, and never load it, or anything else for
the page, from another origin or a CDN.

**Which component for what:**

| For | Use |
|---|---|
| A table of records | `<om-grid row-key="…">`: set `columns`, then `setRows(rows)`; `upsert(rows)` replaces rows by key in place; figures sort exactly |
| A stream: thousands of rows, many changes a second | `<om-grid high-rate>`: only the rows in view are drawn, only changed cells are touched, and they flash up or down; `freeze-sort` stops rows jumping while streaming |
| Live data from the plugin's server | `<om-live src="events" snapshot="snapshot.json" for="grid-id">`: follows server-sent events in sequence, and reads the snapshot again after a gap or a reconnect, so nothing is missed |
| The date the figures are as of | `<om-asof>` |
| Choosing an instrument | `<om-instrument-picker src="…" asof="…">`, searching through the plugin's own server |
| A time series | `<om-chart type="line">` (or `bar`), `series` set in script |
| Several views on one page, resizable and rearrangeable | `<om-panels layout-id="…">`, a `data-panel` child per view; each person's arrangement is remembered |
| Everything else | The kit's classes: `.page`, `.page-head`, `.panel` and `.panel-body`, `.tiles`, `.tabs`, `.field`, `.filters`, `.notice`, `.badge`, `button.primary` and `.danger`, `table` and `.num`, `.empty-state` |

Give a component its data as JSON inside it, `<script
type="application/json">{{ grid | tojson }}</script>`, which needs no script of the
page's; or set it (`columns`, `rows`, `series`) as properties, in a
`customElements.whenDefined(...)` callback. The kit's README
(open-meridian/meridian-ui) documents every component, attribute and event.

**Colour.** Only the kit's custom properties, never a hex, `rgb()`, `hsl()` or
a colour's name: not in a stylesheet, an inline style, an SVG or a script. A
person chooses their scheme and their deployment's administrator may add
schemes; a raw colour is one no scheme can change and no contrast check has
seen. Prefer a class to a property, and a property to anything else:

- surfaces `--page`, `--card`, `--hover`; text `--ink`, `--ink-soft`,
  `--ink-faint`; edges `--line`, `--line-soft`, `--line-strong`
- `--accent` and `--accent-wash`; `--primary` and `--primary-ink`
- status, which never changes meaning: `--good`, `--danger`, `--warn-ink`,
  `--violet`, each with its `-wash`
- **market direction:** `--buy` for a buy, a rise or a gain, and `--sell` for a
  sell, a fall or a loss, with `--buy-wash` and `--sell-wash`. Never green and
  red, and never `--good` and `--danger`, for a price move: where a person
  reads red as up (China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan) the kit swaps buy and sell for
  them. In markup, `.buy-ink` and `.sell-ink`, `.badge.buy` and `.badge.sell`;
  in a grid, a column's `tone: "sign"`.

Spacing, radii, shadows and type are the kit's too: `var(--space-1)` to
`var(--space-10)`, `var(--radius)`, `var(--shadow)`, `var(--sans)`,
`var(--mono)`.

**No chrome, no theme code.** The dashboard frames the page and draws the
plugin's name, its tab row, the way back to the dashboard and the person. The
page draws only its content, which the base template puts inside `<main
class="page">`: no header bar, navigation, logo, sign-in or sign-out, and no
light and dark switch. The kit applies the
person's theme, which the frame hands it, with no code of the page's.

**Money is exact.** Send prices and quantities to the page as decimal strings
and show them as sent; never `parseFloat` one. The grid sorts them exactly.

**The kit's rules, which a page keeps too:** no raw colour; no custom
property the kit does not define, other than the page's own layout ones; the
page reaches only its own origin, the plugin's server, which proxies anything
further; figures are strings, never floats.

**Where the kit is not served.** Until every dashboard serves `/.meridian/ui/`,
build pages that work without it, as the templates do: put a plain `<table>`
inside `<om-grid>` (a browser shows it as it is, and the kit's grid replaces
it), give components their data as JSON inside them, and make actions plain
forms. Without the kit the page is unstyled, but everything on it works.

A short page, whole: the view, in `page.py`,

```python
COLUMNS = [
    {"key": "symbol", "label": "Instrument"},
    {"key": "quantity", "label": "Quantity", "type": "decimal", "group": True},
    {"key": "market_value", "label": "Market value", "type": "decimal", "group": True},
    {"key": "day_pnl", "label": "Day P&L", "type": "decimal", "group": True, "tone": "sign"},
]


@pages.page("/positions", "Positions", levels=["write", "read"])
def positions(request: meridian.Request) -> str:
    return pages.render("positions.html", grid={"columns": COLUMNS, "rows": []})
```

and its template, `templates/positions.html`:

```html+jinja
{% extends "meridian/base.html" %}
{% block head_actions %}
<om-live src="events" snapshot="positions.json" for="positions"></om-live>
{% endblock %}
{% block content %}
<p class="muted">Every account you may read here.</p>
<section class="panel">
  <om-grid id="positions" row-key="position_id" high-rate sort="market_value:desc" caption="Positions">
    <script type="application/json">{{ grid | tojson }}</script>
    <table><tr><th>Instrument</th><th>Quantity</th><th>Market value</th></tr></table>
  </om-grid>
</section>
{% endblock %}
```

The plugin's server answers `positions.json` with `{ "sequence": "41", "rows":
[…] }` and `events` as server-sent events, each `id: <sequence>` and `data:
{ "rows": […] }` carrying whole records; `om-live` feeds them to the grid.

## Developing it live

On a Meridian deployment installed for development, `meridian plugin dev`
runs this plugin as you write it: each saved file is sent, the plugin's process
restarts on it in the same pod, and it is running again in about a second. The
pod, its sidecar and what it is allowed to do stay as they were.

Everything here runs on the person's own session with the deployment, and is
theirs.

### Before starting

- `meridian --version` is 0.1.21 or later. Older ones have no `--level` on
  `plugin open`, before 0.1.15 no `plugin check`, and before 0.1.3 no
  `plugin dev`: the person runs `meridian upgrade`.
- The person has run `meridian connect` (with the address, for a deployment
  not on this machine). You cannot do it for them: it signs in through their
  browser. `meridian plugin list` says whether the
  session is there: it lists the catalogue, or exits **3**. Whenever any
  command exits 3, the session is missing or has lapsed. Stop, tell the person
  to run the `meridian connect` the command printed, and carry on once they
  have. There is no `meridian status`.
- The deployment was installed for development (`meridian up --development`).
  Elsewhere `plugin dev` is refused, and nothing is wrong with the plugin.

### Start the loop

The instance is called `databento` below. Use whatever the person
wants it called, and the same name in every command.

**The first time an instance is launched, the person approves what it asks
for.** Show them the `roles` in `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.meridian]`
and ask. Only once they say yes, pass `--yes`; never pass it to get past a
question they have not answered. An instance that is live already asks
nothing.

Run it in the background, and keep it running for the whole session:

```sh
mkdir -p .meridian
meridian plugin dev --instance databento --yes --json > .meridian/dev.jsonl 2> .meridian/dev.err
```

Its output goes under `.meridian/` on purpose. `plugin dev` sends every file
in this directory that changes, except `.meridian/` and what `.dockerignore`
names. Anywhere else in this directory, its own output would be sent to the
plugin as a change, again and again. Not under your own agent's directory
(`.claude/`, `.cursor/` and the like) either: some agents guard theirs, and
writing there needs a permission a session may not have. `.meridian/` is
git-ignored, since it is this session's, not the plugin's.

`.meridian/dev.jsonl` gets one JSON object a line:

| `event` | Means |
|---|---|
| `seeded` | The live folder was filled from the plugin's image, the first time it runs live |
| `sent` | This process sent a change; `revision` is the number it was given |
| `synced` | The sidecar wrote it |
| `restarted` | The plugin's process started on that revision |
| `ready` | It connected to its sidecar again: that revision is running |
| `crashed` | It stopped with an error. `traceback` has the last of what it printed |
| `exited` | It stopped by itself, without an error |
| `refused` | The sidecar refused it something; `reason` says what |

Wait for the first `ready` before changing anything. `.meridian/dev.err` says
what it is doing, and why it stopped if it did. The first run builds and
uploads the plugin's image, which takes a minute or two.

### Change something

1. Edit and save. There is nothing to run: the save is the deploy.
2. Find the `sent` line after your save, and its `revision`, R.
3. Wait for `ready` or `crashed` at R. Nothing about R is known before then.
4. On `crashed`, read its `traceback`, fix the cause, and save again: the next
   revision replaces it. Nothing needs restarting.

Several saves close together can land as one revision. Read the newest `sent`.

### Check it

Ask the question that answers what you changed:

| To know | Run |
|---|---|
| What a page shows, as the person is served it | `meridian plugin open --instance databento --level open --print /` for Accounts under Open (`--level view` under View), and `--level manage --print /setup` for Setup under Manage: any path on the plugin, at a level it is declared with |
| What the plugin printed or logged since your change | `meridian plugin logs --instance databento --since <R-1>` |
| What the sidecar refused it, or what else happened | `meridian plugin events --instance databento --since <R-1> --json` |
| What the person sees in a browser | `meridian plugin open --instance databento --level open`: a link one browser opens once, at that level. Give it to the person, or open it in your browser pane |

`--level` is the home's button the session is opened by: `manage`, `open` or
`view`. Name it every time. A page answers 403 at a level it is not declared
with, and without `--level` the dashboard opens at the first level the person
holds, Manage before Open before View, so on a development deployment, where
they hold `admin`, `/` would be asked under Manage and refused.

`--print` exits non-zero when the plugin answers with an error, and prints what
it answered. Prefer it to a browser for checking your own work: it needs no
browser and gives the same page every time.

### What a save cannot change

- **What it is allowed to do.** A `refused` event is its grants working, not a
  bug to code around. Adding a role to `pyproject.toml` changes nothing
  live: it takes a new version, and a person approves it.
- **Its dependencies.** The live code runs on the image the instance was
  launched from. A new package in `pyproject.toml` needs a new version.

Tell the person when a change needs either, rather than looking for a way
round it.

### Release it

When the person is satisfied:

1. Run `meridian plugin check --run-tests`, and fix what fails until it
   exits 0.
2. Raise `version` in `pyproject.toml`. A version is never replaced.
3. Show the person the roles again, and get their yes.
4. Run `meridian plugin dev --release --instance databento --yes`.

That uploads this directory as that version and runs it in place of the live
instance. It is then an ordinary version in the deployment's catalogue.

### Stop

Stop the background `plugin dev`. The instance keeps running, live, as it was.
`meridian plugin stop databento` ends it, which is the person's call.

## Publish it to a registry

To list a version on the platform's registry, publish a signed release tag
of it:

1. Once: `meridian plugin key setup`. It makes git's SSH signing key ready,
   or a new one, sets git to sign tags with it, and registers its public half
   on the organisation. Somebody who is not the organisation's Owner or Admin
   is told to ask one, with the line to give them.
2. Then, once the change's pull request is merged and main's CI is green:
   `meridian plugin release X.Y.Z`, the version `pyproject.toml` and
   `CHANGELOG.md` already say. It checks the checkout is on main, clean and
   up to date; X.Y.Z is higher than the last release tag; `pyproject.toml`
   says X.Y.Z; `CHANGELOG.md` has its `## X.Y.Z` heading; and main's CI is
   green. Then it signs `vX.Y.Z` on main's head, pushes it, publishes it and
   follows the build until it is listed, queued for review, or refused. It
   opens no pull request and changes no file; each refusal says what to do
   next. It reads main's CI with the person's GitHub sign-in: `GH_TOKEN` or
   `GITHUB_TOKEN`, else the credential git keeps for github.com.
