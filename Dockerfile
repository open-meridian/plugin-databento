# Built on the base image for the SDK this plugin pins: Python and
# open-meridian, the same version as pyproject.toml's, already installed. So
# the image's own layer is this plugin, and an upload sends only that. Move
# the two together when moving to a new SDK.
#
# BASE is for building against a base made locally rather than a released one.
# The release by its tag and its digest, the image exactly; move both together.
